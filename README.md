# üß† Tug of War Simulation (Multiprocessing + OpenGL)

This project is a Linux-based simulation of a **Tug of War** game using **multiprocessing** and **OpenGL** for visualization. The simulation consists of three processes:
- `referee`: Manages the game rules, logic, and communication.
- `player`: Represents a team player that responds to referee signals.
- `graphics`: Handles graphical representation using OpenGL.

Each team consists of 4 players, and the game progresses over multiple rounds based on player energy, strategy, and random events like falling.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Multi-process communication using **signals**, **pipes**, and **fifos**.
- Dynamic configuration from text files (or use defaults).
- Real-time visualization with **OpenGL + GLFW + FreeType**.
- Energy-based game mechanics, randomized behaviors, and fall recovery.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

Three configuration files control the simulation. If not provided, default ones will be generated.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions (Linux)

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

### ‚úÖ Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libfreetype6-dev
```

## üî® Build the Programs

### To compile all components:

```bash
make
```

and then to run:

```bash
./bin/referee
```

Compiled binaries will be placed in the `bin/` directory.
